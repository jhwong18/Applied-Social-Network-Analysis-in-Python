This repository contains a collection of the assignments used in the course Applied Social Network Analysis in Python, part of Applied Data Science using Python Specialization from University of Michigan offered by Coursera

This course will introduce the learner to network analysis through tutorials using the NetworkX library. The course begins with an understanding of what network analysis is and motivations for why we might model phenomena as networks. The second week introduces the concept of connectivity and network robustness. The third week will explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. The final week will explore the evolution of networks over time and cover models of network generation and the link prediction problem.
